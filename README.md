- 💬 Ask me about: Anything Cloud Security (with AWS, and Azure), Linux, Python, and so on. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me through juniorliango01@gmail.com or LinkedIn
- ⚡ Fun fact: 

Call me Atouba. I am passionate about architecting and implementing robust security solutions to protect cloud infrastructure and data assets. I'm also passionate about automation and its implementation in everyday tasks. 

Proven expertise in threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response within Azure environments. 

Keen interest and developing skills in:
- Cybersecurity Operations: Proactive threat hunting, security analytics, and automated incident response.
- Data Security & Governance: Secure data handling, extraction, exfiltration prevention, and compliance.
- Data Engineering: Building secure and efficient data pipelines (ETLs) for security data analysis using Python and Pandas.
- AI & Automation: Leveraging AI/ML and LLMs for intelligent security automation, threat prediction, and anomaly detection.

I am actively seeking challenging roles where I can contribute to enhancing cloud security posture and leverage data-driven insights to mitigate risks.

🚀 Featured Projects
Here are some projects that showcase my skills and interests. (You will need to build these projects and link your actual GitHub repositories).

1. Project Sentinel: AI-Powered Azure Phishing Email Analyzer
Description: Developed a Python-based solution that integrates with Azure Sentinel to analyze suspicious emails.
The system extracts email content and headers, leverages an LLM (e.g., Azure OpenAI Service) to identify phishing indicators (e.g., sender impersonation, malicious links, urgent language), and automatically creates a high-fidelity incident in Azure Sentinel with enriched data for security analysts.

Technologies Used:
- Azure Sentinel (SIEM/SOAR)
- Azure Logic Apps (for email ingestion or workflow automation)
- Azure Functions (Python runtime for analysis logic)
- Python (Core logic, API interaction)
- LLM API (e.g., Azure OpenAI Service)
- Microsoft Graph API (for email access if applicable)
- Key Features & Accomplishments:
- Automated ingestion and parsing of email data.
- Intelligent phishing detection using NLP capabilities of LLMs.
- Seamless incident creation and enrichment in Azure Sentinel.
- Reduced manual effort for phishing analysis and improved response times.
